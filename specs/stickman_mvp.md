# Stickman MVP Spec (Roadmap: P7-T0)

## Goal
Ship a runnable Fedora-first Tauri desktop MVP with a borderless stickman that moves, performs simple funny actions, and emits contextual local-rule messages.

## Scope
- Borderless transparent desktop UI in Tauri.
- Small stickman character with visible movement and playful animation skills.
- Contextual messages based on local UI/user actions only (no LLM in MVP).
- Extensible skin + animation structure so new skins/skills can be added later.

## Deferred (tracked in roadmap)
- `P7-T8`: LLM-backed contextual message generation.
- `P7-T9`: richer user interaction/intents pipeline.

## Notes
- Fedora GNOME is the primary qualification environment for this MVP.
